There are several kinds of Naïve Bayes classifiers implemented in scikit-
learn (as of v0.23.2):

‣ GaussianNB: for continuous variables
‣ MultinomialNB: for count data, such as text
‣ ComplementNB: an adaptation of multinomial NB for imbalanced data sets
‣ BernoulliNB: for binary data
‣ CategoricalNB: for discrete data
